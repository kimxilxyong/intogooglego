If you can cope with lots of (international) travel, repeating the same speech over and over and over, subsisting on pizza and cheap beer, and listening to over-confident neophytes explaining why their plan to beat Facebook is rock solid - it may be the job for you!As with any role, the best way to demonstrate your worth is to develop a portfolio.  Give talks at every meetup you can.  Make sure they're video'd - watch them back and learn from your mistakes.Get a name for yourself on StackOverflow (or whatever) as someone who can clearly and concisely explain a solution.Write dozens of blog posts - and get them syndicated - showing how you can write tutorials, answer questions, and explain moderately difficult concepts to a lay audience.Learn how to organise events.  Start your own meetups / hackdays / whatever.  Organising venues, catering, invites, sponsors, speakers, schwag etc is absolutely invaluable experience.  Join the organising committee of your local events.Finally, find a company (preferably with some funding) who you can see needs to get their message out there.  Write up your plan on how you would help them succeed. Which meetups are they best to sponsor? Which merchandise has the best response among developers?  What parts of their proposition need the most explaining.  Pitch your experience.\nA word of warning.  I quit the evangelist game because I couldn't cope with frequent international travel.  It's fun at first - but can play havoc with your personal relationships.",

          "Body": "Here's what worked for me. I did not set out to be an evangelist, more to educate myself about devops, and https://sysadmincasts.com was the result. Ended up getting hired by one of the companies I created a video on (but not in an evangelist role).Here's some things to think about:  - you do not need to be an expert\n  - you can teach yourself to be an evangelist (probably the best way)\n  - 22 is *young* (I have 10 years on you)\n  - almost better if you know nothing as you learn from the ground up\n  - you will learn everything you need to know along the way\n\nHere's my suggested strategy:Start a blog or youtube channel where you review products around an eco-system. Boom, you now run your own evangelist company, congratulations! Keep that this consistently for a few years. Focus your reviews on a specific company or series of product lines. You will get on people's radar. This will bring in job offers. A few things that I can think of off the top of my head re: the journey.  - pick an emerging tech eco-system (I chose devops)\n  - something shiny and new (devops)\n  - educate yourself about said eco-system\n  - educate others about what you learned (brain dumps)\n  - chunk these into small 1-2k word postings (blog or video)\n  - was doing a weekly video release (hope to get back on a schedule)\n  - it will be extremely painful in the beginning as you will suck (I did)\n  - you will quickly become better and improve your craft\n  - have a release cycle to keep you motivated with an end in sight\n  - set clear goals for what each posting will be about\n  - show examples (code, workflow, diagrams, etc)\n  - weekly cycle will force you to keep things small and workable\n  - just takes time and effort to research\n  - it's easy to write simple brain dumps about what you learned\n  - this could take years (it did in my case)\n  - don't write crap postings or spam content\n  - we are sick of corporate marketing/hype/vapor crap\n  - an unpolished human-to-human conversation works very well!\n  - show example use-cases (who, how, what, why, when, etc)\n  - people will recognize you provide value\n  - this will open doors beyond your wildest expectations\n  - you will gradually become an expert\n  - very rewarding to help people from around the world\n  - can take over your life if you let it\n  - force yourself to keep quality up over all else (don't be lazy)\n  - you can do this along side your day job\n  - builds proof that you can be an evangelist\n  - you will become much better at distilling concepts\n  - this provides extreme value for time crunched people\n\nThe trick is to keep yourself motivated. If you look at many information products today (podcasts, youtube channels, magazines), most of them follow a model like this, just copy it. Just the reward of helping others alone makes this worth it, so you really cannot go wrong! In that, even if you do not become a full-time evangelist, you have educated yourself, educated others, built a public profile, and that will pay off big time when looking for work in the future.",
